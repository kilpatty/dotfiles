For decades they've used TODO style code comments to track issues that almost never end up in issue tracking software.  imdone is a plugin for your favorite text editor that turns code comments into trackable issues.  It collects all TODO style comments in your project and organizes them in a drag and drop task-board that integrates with any web based issue tracking system.\n\nimdone works best with todo.txt and markdown syntax.  See the [syntax guide at imdone-core](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#task-formats) for details.\n\nWhats new!\n----\n- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **Todays's Journal** - Open today's journal file as configured in settings.  Great for people who like to keep plain text notes.\n- :zap: **Open all files for visible tasks!**\n- **Open task links in [intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html) family of products with imdone-atom and [imdone intellij plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8067)!**\n- **[How To Write Plugins](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-atom/wiki/How-To-Write-Plugins) for imdone-atom**\n- **Link your TODO comments to github issues.  Try the [imdone-atom-github](https://atom.io/packages/imdone-atom-github) plugin!**\n\nInstall\n----\n```\n$ apm install imdone-atom\n```\nor open Atom and go to Preferences > Install and search for `imdone-atom`\n\nCommands\n----\n| Command Palette               | Key Mapping | Description              |\n|:------------------------------|:------------|:-------------------------|\n| `Imdone Atom: Tasks`          | Alt+T       | Open task board          |\n| `Imdone Atom: Todays Journal` | Alt+J       | Open todays journal file |\n\nSettings\n----\n| Name                               | Type    | Default     | Description                                                                                    |\n|:-----------------------------------|:--------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Exclude Vcs Ignored Paths          | boolean | false       | Exclude files that are ignored by your version control system                                  |\n| File Opener Port                   | integer | 9799        | Port the file opener communicates on                                                           |\n| Max Files Prompt                   | integer | 2500        | How many files is too many to parse without prompting to add ignores?                          |\n| Open in Intellij                   | string  | ''          | [Glob pattern](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) for files that should open in Intellij.    |\n| Show Notifications                 | boolean | false       | Show notifications upon clicking task source link.                                             |\n| Show Tags Inline                   | boolean | false       | Display inline tag and context links in task text?                                             |\n| Today's Journal Date Format        | string  | YYYY-MM-DD  | How would you like your `date` variable formatted?                                             |\n| Today's Journal Directory          | string  | $HOME/notes | Where do you want your journal files to live?

For example, if your project is in `/home/jesse/projects/imdone-atom` and your `.imdoneignore` looks like this, then all files and folders in `/home/jesse/projects/imdone-atom/lib` will be ignored.\n```\nlib\n```\n- .imdone/config.json  \nimdone will also ignore files and folders that match a regex in the `.imdone/config.json`, `exclude` array.  The array is seeded with some common excludes on first run.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If your project is large (#files > 1000) consider adding an .imdoneignore file.\n\nHow To Link Code And Github Issues\n----\nUsing [todo.txt metadata](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#metadata) in your tasks and a minor change to `.imdone/config.json`, you can link to external resources like github issues and profiles.  \n\n- Add a `meta` attribute to `.imdone/config.json`  \n```javascript\n\"meta\": {\n  \"issue\": {\n    \"urlTemplate\": \"https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core/issues/%s\",\n    \"titleTemplate\": \"github issue #%s\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Use `issue:[gh issue id]` as metadata in your tasks.  \n<pre>\n// &#35;BACKLOG:0 issue:27 Export TODOs\n</pre>\n\n- Your issue is linked to the comment!  \n![gh-issue-imdone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/233505/9595122/72542350-502a-11e5-87b3-a4eb49428b7c.png)\n\nLook at [imdone/imdone-core#metadata](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#metadata) for more info.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/imdone/imdone-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/imdone/imdone-atom#readme","_id":"imdone-atom@1.3.29","_shasum":"b76aebf2c1ac8c5b33cafe8fa16166a1bb961f5c","_resolved":"file:../d-116229-6307-14e8udq/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116229-6307-14e8udq/package.tgz"}
